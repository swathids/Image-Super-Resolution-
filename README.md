# Image-Super-Resolution-
Digital Image Processing enhances and analyzes images for use in fields like medical imaging, surveillance, and remote sensing. This project applies interpolation methods and a deep learning-based SRCNN to perform image super-resolution, using Python for implementation and evaluation via PSNR and SSIM.
